The goal is to find 3x3 clusters in eta and phi directions for each zbin, 
  and output the data of the zbin with the maximum total pT of clusters (HT) for each event.

The find_clusters() function takes input of an array of track_data structures
  and outputs an array of maxzbin structures (both specified in tracklet_em.h).
